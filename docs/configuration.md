# Configuration

Scanner configuration is YAML-based. The default file is
`scanner/config/default.yaml`; deployments can provide another file through
`OCTO_CONFIG`.

## Configuration order

Effective scanner settings are built from:

1. the selected YAML file;
2. deployment environment variables;
3. installation-wide API overrides for whitelisted editable paths;
4. job-specific options.

API overrides are validated against the full scanner schema before persistence.
Secrets are not exposed or editable from the Web UI.

## Profiles

Use a conservative profile for a new target set and increase concurrency only
after observing coverage, target stability, and network impact.

| Profile | Discovery behavior | Recommended use |
|---|---|---|
| `safe` | Lower rates and conservative external-tool settings | First scan, fragile or remote links |
| `balanced` | Normal rates and staged gap handling | Routine authorized scanning |
| `fast` | Higher rate and reduced secondary work | Controlled, high-capacity environments |
| `thorough` | Verification, ICMP, and fuller hostname work | Deep assessment with a larger window |

Profile names and exact values are defined in the active YAML. Do not treat the
table as a fixed performance guarantee.

## Input contract

| File | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `scanner/inputs/ranges.txt` | IPv4/IPv6 address or CIDR | One entry per line |
| `scanner/inputs/domains.txt` | FQDN | Normalized and resolved |
| `scanner/inputs/ports.txt` | TCP port or supported range | Optional override |
| `scanner/inputs/ports_udp.txt` | UDP port or supported range | Optional override |

Invalid lines are reported. A run with no valid targets exits with code `3`.

## Protocol selection

TCP is the default. UDP adds materially more time and uncertainty; keep its port
list focused. Combined scans preserve protocol in intermediate and aggregate
results.

```yaml
scan:
  protocol: tcp
```

Supported deployment/job options can select `tcp`, `udp`, or `both`.

## NSE and vulnerability checks

NSE profiles control which scripts run after port discovery. Start with
service-specific and safe checks, then enable broader vulnerability scripts for
authorized targets and a suitable maintenance window.

Nuclei is an optional stage. Template version, severity filters, concurrency,
and rate limits should be pinned in production.

## Discovery modules

Optional modules include:

- CT-log subdomain collection;
- wordlist-based subdomain discovery;
- Cloudflare zone import;
- ASN/prefix discovery via RIPEstat;
- public cloud-resource candidate checks;
- typosquat and dangling-CNAME monitoring;
- offline ASN and GeoIP enrichment.

Several modules query third-party infrastructure. Enable them deliberately,
keep candidate/concurrency caps, and review their data-handling policies.

## Enrichment sources

| Source | Purpose | Typical update |
|---|---|---|
| GeoIP MMDB | Country and city | Provider release cadence |
| ASN MMDB | ASN and organization | Provider release cadence |
| EPSS | Exploit probability | Daily |
| CISA KEV | Known exploitation | Daily |
| CVSS v4 overlay | Score/vector enrichment | With source updates |

The Kubernetes enrichment overlay provides a shared PVC and scheduled refresh.
Placeholder fixture data is suitable only for tests.

### CVSS v4 baseline and refresh

`scanner/data/cvss4/cvss4.json` is committed and baked into every image as the
baseline, then kept current in place — the daily refresh does not rebuild it:

```bash
# Baseline rebuild — pages the whole NVD corpus, run rarely and by hand.
# Set NVD_API_KEY first: it is ~10x faster (50 vs 5 req/30s).
python3 scripts/fetch-cvss4-db.py --full -o scanner/data/cvss4/cvss4.json

# Incremental — what scripts/fetch-enrichment.sh runs daily.
python3 scripts/fetch-cvss4-db.py --last-mod-days 8
```

Every mode merges into the existing file, so a CVE already scored is never
dropped by a later run, and a `--full` rebuild that returns nothing (or fails
mid-way) refuses to publish rather than replacing a good database with an empty
one. `--seed` unions the image's committed baseline into an existing database,
which is how a newer baseline reaches a volume that already has one — the seed
"floor" in `fetch-enrichment.sh` only fires when the file is absent, and an
incremental run only adds recently-modified CVEs.

### NVD API: known traps

Every one of these cost real debugging time. They are the reason the fetcher
looks more defensive than a paging loop ought to.

- **`cvssV4Severity` does not select v4-scored CVEs.** Querying it returns a
  handful of results against a corpus where roughly a third of recent CVEs carry
  `cvssMetricV40`. There is no server-side way to ask for "CVEs with a v4
  score", so `--full` pages the entire corpus and filters client-side.
- **Throttling arrives as a trickle, not a 429.** Under concurrency NVD stops
  sending body bytes without closing the connection or returning an error code.
  Sockets stay `ESTABLISHED` with frozen byte counters. A socket timeout cannot
  catch this — it is per-operation, and the occasional few bytes reset it
  forever — so `_read_bounded()` puts a wall-clock ceiling on the whole body.
  Eight concurrent pages reliably triggered this within about five minutes;
  four is the shipped default.
- **HTTP 503 is routine**, not an outage. It appears mid-run under load and
  clears on backoff, so it is retried like 429 rather than treated as fatal.
- **Deep pagination is slow.** A 2000-CVE page is ~9 MB and takes NVD around
  20 seconds to render, so a serial full rebuild is roughly an hour. Wall-clock
  is dominated by that latency, not by the request rate — an API key raises the
  ceiling from 5 to 50 req/30s but only cuts about a quarter off a serial run.
- **Most older CVEs have no v4 score at all.** `CVE-2014-0160`, `CVE-2021-44228`
  and friends carry only `cvssMetricV31`/`cvssMetricV2`. CVSS v3.x is
  deliberately never substituted, since these scores are consumed downstream as
  genuine v4 — so a fetch restricted to well-known old CVEs returns nothing.
  About 1,900 entries do come from CVEs published before 2024, added
  retroactively by CNAs, which is why `--full` does not skip the older corpus.

## Environment variables

Core deployment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OCTO_CONFIG` | Scanner YAML path |
| `OCTO_OUTPUT_DIR` | Per-run output root |
| `OCTO_STATE_DIR` | Checkpoint and scheduler state |
| `OCTO_JWT_SECRET` | User JWT signing secret |
| `OCTO_POSTGRES_URL` | Primary database connection |
| `OCTO_NATS_URL` | JetStream connection; empty disables NATS |
| `OCTO_CLICKHOUSE_URL` | ClickHouse HTTP connection |
| `OCTO_CH_INGEST_ENABLED` | Enable analytical ingest worker |
| `OCTO_JOB_EXECUTION_MODE` | `local` or `agent` |
| `OCTO_INSTANCE_ID` | Identity of this API replica in the shared job queue; defaults to the hostname. Only local-mode jobs owned by this identity are failed as orphans on startup |
| `OCTO_ALLOW_SCAN_START` | Permit job creation from API/UI |
| `OCTO_ASSET_STALE_DAYS` | Age threshold for stale assets |

Job leases and the reaper (see [architecture.md](architecture.md#leases)):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OCTO_JOB_LEASE_SECONDS` | `300` | How long a claimed/running job survives without its executor renewing. Keep it well above the agent heartbeat interval — too low and live scans are requeued under a working agent |
| `OCTO_JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Hand-outs a job gets before an expired lease fails it instead of requeueing it |
| `OCTO_JOB_REAPER_ENABLED` | `true` | Run the expiry sweep in this replica. Safe in all replicas; disabling it everywhere means abandoned jobs stay in flight forever |
| `OCTO_JOB_REAPER_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | Sweep interval |

Recurring-scan dispatcher (see
[architecture.md](architecture.md#schedule-dispatcher-leadership)):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OCTO_SCHEDULER_DISPATCH_ENABLED` | `true` | Start the dispatcher thread in this replica. Safe to leave on everywhere: only the replica holding the advisory lock dispatches. Disabling it in *every* replica stops recurring scans entirely |

Endpoint inventory (Lariska ingestion):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_ENABLED` | `true` | Register the `/api/endpoint` router at all |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `15728640` | Hard request-body cap, checked from `Content-Length` before JSON parsing |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_SOFTWARE_ITEMS` | `5000` | Software entries per snapshot |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_IDENTIFIERS` | `16` | Hashed platform identifiers per snapshot |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_LABELS` | `32` | Labels per snapshot |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_STRING_LENGTH` | `512` | Per-field string bound |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_SNAPSHOT_AGE_SECONDS` | `86400` | Reject snapshots collected longer ago than this |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_SECONDS` | `300` | Tolerated clock skew on `collected_at` |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` | `12` | Accepted submissions per agent per hour |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_STALE_HOURS` | `48` | Age after which a device reports `status: "stale"` |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_RETENTION_ENABLED` | `true` | Run the in-process retention sweep |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` | Age after which a snapshot's software rows are pruned |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_INVENTORY_CHANGE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `365` | Age after which software change events are deleted |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_RETENTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `21600` | Sweep interval |
| `OCTO_ENDPOINT_RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE` | `5000` | Rows deleted per statement |

secret mechanism.

## Validate before a run

```bash
python -m scanner.main \
  --config scanner/config/default.yaml \
  --validate-config
```

Also render deployment configuration before applying it:

```bash
kubectl kustomize k8s/shapoclyack/overlays/dev >/dev/null
```
