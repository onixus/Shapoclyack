# Configuration

Scanner configuration is YAML-based. The default file is
`scanner/config/default.yaml`; deployments can provide another file through
`OCTO_CONFIG`.

## Configuration order

Effective scanner settings are built from:

1. the selected YAML file;
2. deployment environment variables;
3. installation-wide API overrides for whitelisted editable paths;
4. job-specific options.

API overrides are validated against the full scanner schema before persistence.
Secrets are not exposed or editable from the Web UI.

## Profiles

Use a conservative profile for a new target set and increase concurrency only
after observing coverage, target stability, and network impact.

| Profile | Discovery behavior | Recommended use |
|---|---|---|
| `safe` | Lower rates and conservative external-tool settings | First scan, fragile or remote links |
| `balanced` | Normal rates and staged gap handling | Routine authorized scanning |
| `fast` | Higher rate and reduced secondary work | Controlled, high-capacity environments |
| `thorough` | Verification, ICMP, and fuller hostname work | Deep assessment with a larger window |

Profile names and exact values are defined in the active YAML. Do not treat the
table as a fixed performance guarantee.

## Input contract

| File | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `scanner/inputs/ranges.txt` | IPv4/IPv6 address or CIDR | One entry per line |
| `scanner/inputs/domains.txt` | FQDN | Normalized and resolved |
| `scanner/inputs/ports.txt` | TCP port or supported range | Optional override |
| `scanner/inputs/ports_udp.txt` | UDP port or supported range | Optional override |

Invalid lines are reported. A run with no valid targets exits with code `3`.

## Protocol selection

TCP is the default. UDP adds materially more time and uncertainty; keep its port
list focused. Combined scans preserve protocol in intermediate and aggregate
results.

```yaml
scan:
  protocol: tcp
```

Supported deployment/job options can select `tcp`, `udp`, or `both`.

## NSE and vulnerability checks

NSE profiles control which scripts run after port discovery. Start with
service-specific and safe checks, then enable broader vulnerability scripts for
authorized targets and a suitable maintenance window.

Nuclei is an optional stage. Template version, severity filters, concurrency,
and rate limits should be pinned in production.

## Discovery modules

Optional modules include:

- CT-log subdomain collection;
- wordlist-based subdomain discovery;
- Cloudflare zone import;
- ASN/prefix discovery via RIPEstat;
- public cloud-resource candidate checks;
- typosquat and dangling-CNAME monitoring;
- offline ASN and GeoIP enrichment.

Several modules query third-party infrastructure. Enable them deliberately,
keep candidate/concurrency caps, and review their data-handling policies.

## Enrichment sources

| Source | Purpose | Typical update |
|---|---|---|
| GeoIP MMDB | Country and city | Provider release cadence |
| ASN MMDB | ASN and organization | Provider release cadence |
| EPSS | Exploit probability | Daily |
| CISA KEV | Known exploitation | Daily |
| CVSS v4 overlay | Score/vector enrichment | With source updates |

The Kubernetes enrichment overlay provides a shared PVC and scheduled refresh.
Placeholder fixture data is suitable only for tests.

## Environment variables

Core deployment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OCTO_CONFIG` | Scanner YAML path |
| `OCTO_OUTPUT_DIR` | Per-run output root |
| `OCTO_STATE_DIR` | Checkpoint and scheduler state |
| `OCTO_JWT_SECRET` | User JWT signing secret |
| `OCTO_POSTGRES_URL` | Primary database connection |
| `OCTO_NATS_URL` | JetStream connection; empty disables NATS |
| `OCTO_CLICKHOUSE_URL` | ClickHouse HTTP connection |
| `OCTO_CH_INGEST_ENABLED` | Enable analytical ingest worker |
| `OCTO_JOB_EXECUTION_MODE` | `local` or `agent` |
| `OCTO_ALLOW_SCAN_START` | Permit job creation from API/UI |
| `OCTO_ASSET_STALE_DAYS` | Age threshold for stale assets |

Never commit real URLs containing credentials. Supply them through the platform
secret mechanism.

## Validate before a run

```bash
python -m scanner.main \
  --config scanner/config/default.yaml \
  --validate-config
```

Also render deployment configuration before applying it:

```bash
kubectl kustomize k8s/octo-man/overlays/dev >/dev/null
```
